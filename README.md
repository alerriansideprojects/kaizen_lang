## Intro

This is intended as a learning platform to discover some of how underlying systems in programming languages function.


## Personal Goals
1. Practice Golang and maintain my personal proficiency in the language
2. Understand how different languages are built, particularly the most common interpreted language sets like Python and Ruby. In order to get a better understanding of languages from the ground up.
3. Because it is a ton of fun exploring any language, spoken or programming, from the ground up like this my last goal is to have fun using a language I don't get to use often enough and explore some deep programming concepts.

## Credits / Expectations
I am following the amazing pair of books by Thorsten Ball, titled *Writing an Interpreter in Go* and *Writing a Compiler in Go*. While some of my names and other objects are different than what is presented in these books, all credit for how this is constructed goes to those two sources.

I am not trying to build the next big programming language set, there are already way too many of those available. I am simply here for some fun exploration that allows me to stretch my brain and learn something new.

Thanks!
